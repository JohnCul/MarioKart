# MarioKart
Stats collection for the new season

DO NOT TOUCH THE PLAYERDATA FOLDER! This is what saves and loads the stats

To run the program to get the stats updated, do "javac Main.Java", "java Main Stats". This will regenerate the stats with the current numbers

To run the program with a new Grand Prix, do "javac Main.Java", "java Main #Races,#Players,P1Initials,P1Score,P2...."

Example:
"java Main 10,4,JC,102,JP,98,TE,87,LV,85"
This will add a grand prix with 10 races and 4 players, with John winning with 102, Jaden 2nd with 98, Espo 3rd with 87, and Luca 4th with 85
DO NOT ADD ANY SPACES INTO THE STRING OF INPUT. MAKE SURE YOU GET THE INITIALS CORRECT

If you are adding a new player not in the stats, it's very easy. Just type in everything normally and a prompt will pop up asking you to enter
the new player's name. It will create the stats and add them to the sheet and PlayerData. 

DO NOT MESS UP THE STRING OF INPUT. If you do, it may permenantly ruin the stats. I need to add a backup system in here if this happens.

Do not run the program without asking John if it is correct if you are scoring officially.
